# Sendout Confirmation Creator

## Why?

### Why C#?
This is my first C# project. I'm very interested in C# and .Net since it seems there are an abundance of jobs for C# online and from what I've seen online it has a very promising future due to the investment from Microsoft. 

### Why this project in particular?
I wanted to create something simple but something that would be able to help me in the real world. <br>

In my current job in recruitment, each time I arrange an interview I need to create a calendar invite with teams and send it to the client and candidate. <br>

Currently, I copy an old calendar invite and paste it and then have to delete and replace a lot of the information, which can be unnecessarily time consuming. <br>

The idea came to me since last night I was copying and pasting after I glanced at my phone and saw that a client had asked me to schedule an in-person interview as a first stage interview for tomorrow. (I work in a specialist construction industry that can move very fast at times due to project requirements). <br>

I was there at 11pm wishing I was in bed and wishing there was a quicker way to arrange the meeting that would allow me to go back to sleep faster, so I thought of this project idea. <br>

C# is perfect for this because of its integration with Microsoft products and should be easy to create an application that's compatible with Teams.

## Implementation

### What does it need to have?

The project needs to first check whether it's a first stage phone call, teams interview, an in-person interview or a second/further stage interview. <br>

It then needs to take in all the necessary user data: Candidate name, client name, company name, candidate phone number, candidate email, client email, day and time of the interview. It should also contain an optional box to add additional information if needed.<br>

If it's a teams invite, it needs to automatically change the settings so that both the client and candidate can access the interview without me being present.<br>

Because I'm scared of things going wrong and sending the wrong email to the wrong person, it needs to show the calendar invite and allow me to manually review it before I send it at first. <br>

The user needs to be able to customise the message template, include thier email signature etc.
